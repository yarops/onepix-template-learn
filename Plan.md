## ToDo

- [ ] PHP Code Sniffer
    - [ ] Create separate PHP Code Sniffer config just for security checks
    - [ ] Replace code sniffer with PHP Coding Style Fixer
- [ ] Add WordPress container to deploy project locally with one button. No more duplicate plugin for local deployment! (Maybe with Roots/Bedrock?)
- [ ] Add Roots/Acorn as dependency? (A more detailed description than is currently available in the official documentation will be needed.)
- [ ] Add template code for Frontend development? (Vite + ts + linters)
- [ ] Add zip script template for packaging a theme or plugin
- [ ] Add CI configs for GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Add installer to use one code base for different purposes (theme, plugin, library, etc.)
